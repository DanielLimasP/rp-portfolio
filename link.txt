    To download and install django/ pip install django  
    To start the server/ -python manage.py runserver
    To create new project/ django-admin startproject project_name
    Remember to reorder everything inside root folder and move manage.py to root

    Create templates folder inside main project
    To enter shell do this/ python manage.py shell
